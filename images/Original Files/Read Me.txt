Please note that this is the original homepage slider box layerred PNG file.

I have added this file so that you can create your slide images with the original background.

NOTE:

It is important to note that this file is the end result of re-creating the original tutorial,
meaning, it is not a 1 for 1 copy of the original file which can be downloaded from the tutorial page
once you have become a paid member.

If you dont use this file to create your slider images, then you will have to recreate the slider background
as it is based on this file.


Have Fun :)
